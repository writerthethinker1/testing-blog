I recently started to use GarageBand on the iPhone and came up with some Death Note ideas, they are just sketches and I hope to develop them more into main pieces!

There are errors and nothing is finalized, these are just ideas based off the the anime and maybe they help you concentrate?

Anyway, I'll cut to the main stuff, the songs are below for download. They are free since nothing is finalized, just previews of the whole songs. They were made in my spare time for fun too.

I also made another track about going around the world, it features themes from many places in the world. It's down below as well!
