To finally bring a calm and open environment into ways of thought and seek answers to old questions about things. here are the 16 rules of reason. they are well made and organized in a way to help you, the reader, on your journey to truth and calmness. here goes!

1. Avoid claims to race (partiality)

* look more at words, claims, and actions rather than race. from a reasoned point of view, we all did great things in the past, regardless of skin colour and still do today. from a modern point of view, race is much like a colour and has no affect on what a person can do nor think. as if wearing a t-shirt, if you look plainly, the t-shirt has little affect on your consciousness and the great things you can do. what's a little more important than one's race is their habits! see what it is one actually does and thinks. you can be just about any skin type you want but if you aren't kind, calm, and have irritability, few will be able to understand you.

2. Avoid claims to gender (partiality)

* there are counter-examples to gender segregation meaning what was once thought about intelligence and other characteristics has been proven false. any claims to gender besides biological needs will make arguments false.

3. avoid claims to class/income (partiality)

* income inequality is always going to be present as we value different types of work accordingly (perhaps to not a great degree with better policies). that's a fact, but it doesn't neccessarily mean that it selects certain behaviors. all of the mental formulations happen regardless and we can find examples of rich and poor doing things unreasonable and being pursecuted.
