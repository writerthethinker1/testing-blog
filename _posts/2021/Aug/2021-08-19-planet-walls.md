Over the course of July, I went on vacation to Yellowstone National Park and was trying to find something to do during the long drive. I always kept thinking

> You know, the iphones come with planet wallpapers like mars, neptune, and jupiter...why not have more of them? Maybe a whole set of them along with the moon and sun? That'd sound nice...

So, I went online and downloaded some of the planet wallpapers freely available via search engines and edited the photos using an iphone! There's a whole set of the planets available, the milky way galaxy, as well as flowers and stones! Just something to do while traveling, to complete the set Apples gives.
